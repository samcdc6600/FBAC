Commands that may be usefull when we write the main configuration script should
be put here.


Input Device Related Commands:
	List info about input devices:
		xinput list
		
	List specific device properties (for example if sysmouse was an input
	device listed by the above command):
		xinput list-props "sysmouse"
		
	You can also use the peripheral number. For example if the number for
	sysmouse was say 7, we could use the command:
		xinput list-props 7
		
	To list buttons attached to a device (where 7 is the device number, it
	can also be a device name is quots):
		xinput get-button-map 7

	To see which numbers are associated with which buttons (again the same
	thing goes with the argument 7 as it does for the above command. On my
	mouse 4 and 5 are scroll up and down respectively):
		xinput test 7
