Note that version numbers associated with packages should be disiregarded
(unless explicitly stated otherwise) when using pkg install as newer version may
come out.


PDF viewer (we use Zathura and not plain MuPDF as Zathura saves page position
and also allowes the viewing of multiple pages at once (this is usefull when
reading things like text books and it is also just our preference.):
	Packages (we need to install two packages as Zathura relies on MuPDF but
	the package to install Zathura does not install MuPDF):
		zathura-0.4.3_2
		zathura-pdf-mupdf-0.3.5_4


Input devices.
We install imwheel because as far as we can tell freebsd doesn't have evdev
and we thus we cannot change the mouse scroll speed using xinput. Imwheel can
cause multipl page up / page down actions for single scroll up scroll down
actions done with a mouse wheel. This is not ideal but is better then having a
really slow scrolling speed.
