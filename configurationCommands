Commands used to configure the system or that should be placed in a
configuration command should be put here. We will further organize these
commands in the future.

Mouse scroll speed (desktop). This is not ideal as it causes multipl page up /
page down commands for each mouse wheel up / mouse wheel down action and thus
doesn't provide "smooth" scrolling. However it is the best way we could find
since FreeBSD doesn't seem to have evdev and thus a mouse scrolling property
doesn't come up when using the xinput command

# Copy imwheel from wherever we store it to the users home
cp /somwhere/.imwheelrc ~/.imwheelrc
# Use -b 45 to restric imwheel to just the scroll buttons (otherwise it turns
# off the backwards and forwards buttons. Also note that there is an alternative
# syntax as stated here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/421645/imwheel-destroys-back-forth-navigation-buttons-from-my-mouse
# However even though our installed version of imwheel returned
# imwheel 1.0.0pre12 by -=<Long Island Man>=- <jcatki@jonatkins.org>
# The alternative syntax (-b "4 5") didn't work. But the presumably old syntax
# did :)
echo "exec --no-startup-id imwheel -b 45" >> .config/i3/config
